This kernel is meant to be used in conjunction with U-Boot, or as a standalone
kernel (replacing kernel.img or kernel7.img on a RPi2 with only the firmware on).

When running, it will blink and print the words "Hello, Kernel World!" and
"Goodbye, Kernel World!" on the UART of the RPi2, alternately.

This is useful for making sure that the UART works.
