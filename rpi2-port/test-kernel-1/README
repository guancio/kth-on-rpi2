This kernel is meant to be used in conjunction with U-Boot, or as a standalone
kernel (replacing kernel.img or kernel7.img on a RPi2 with only the firmware on).

When running, it will blink the green "OK" LED.

This is useful for making sure that you entire process for compilation and getting the code running on the RPi2 works.
