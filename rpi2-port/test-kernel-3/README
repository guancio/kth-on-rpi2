This kernel is meant to be used in conjunction with U-Boot, or as a standalone
kernel (replacing kernel.img or kernel7.img on a RPi2 with only the firmware on).

It will configure the pins of the RPi2 to communicate using JTAG, and then blink
the green "OK" LED, and print "Hello, kernel world!" and "Goodbye, kernel world!"
alternately.

This is useful for making sure that the JTAG configuration works, and that you
can communicate both over JTAG and UART at the same time.
