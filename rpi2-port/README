This directory contains all the files related to the RPi2 port of the
hypervisor.

Both the test kernels (test-kernel-1 and test-kernel-2) are built with CMake
using the commands:

./configure.sh
make

in their respective directories. This will create an ELF in the current
directory, and an image file called "zImage" in the folder /tftpboot/ (at the
bottom of the directory tree). Make sure you have prepared that folder in
advance, or change the target directory at the bottom of CMakeLists.txt.

boot.scr is a U-Boot boot script which should first be made an image by
executing the command "mkimage -A arm -O linux -T script -C none -n Boot Script 
-d boot.scr boot.scr.uimg" (without quotation marks) in this folder, and then
placed in the root folder of the SD card.
