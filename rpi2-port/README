This directory contains all the files related to the RPi2 port of the
hypervisor.

Tools you will need to use everything in this folder:
CMake (for compiling the kernels): sudo apt-get install cmake
ARM cross-compiler (for compiling the kernels): sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-none-eabi
mkimage (for creating U-Boot images): sudo apt-get install mkimage
A LaTeX distribution (for compiling the Guide): Your choice, although we
recommend TexMaker: sudo apt-get install texmaker
The Raspberry Pi 2 firmware (to get things working on the RPi2): You can
download it to the current folder with: git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware

For the convenience of not swapping the SD card physically:
U-Boot (the remote bootloader tool): You can download it to the current folder 
with: git clone http://git.denx.de/u-boot.git
ARM cross-compiler for U-Boot (to compile U-Boot): apt-get install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf
U-Boot tools (for configuring U-Boot): apt-get install u-boot-tools
xinetd (to set up the server to remote boot from): sudo apt-get install xinetd
tftpd (TFTP server): sudo apt-get install tftpd
tftp (TFTP client): sudo apt-get install tftp

All the test kernels are built using the 
commands:

./configure.sh
make

in their respective directories. This will create an ELF in the current
directory, and an image file called "zImage" in the folder /tftpboot/ (at the
bottom of the directory tree). Make sure you have prepared that folder in
advance, or change the target directory at the bottom of CMakeLists.txt. The test kernels are meant for use with U-Boot, unless they are suffixed with "-standalone"

boot.scr is a U-Boot boot script which should first be made an image by
executing the command "mkimage -A arm -O linux -T script -C none -n Boot Script 
-d boot.scr boot.scr.uimg" (without quotation marks) in this folder, and then
placed in the root folder of the SD card.
